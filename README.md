# ML-Project
In this repository I'm sharing one of my machine learning project which I've performed on System Thread Forecaster, Basically in this project we will be classifying new instances of our data in to 1 and 0, 1 if the System is prone to be attacked by malware 0 elsewhere. I hope my project will help you and guide you in your machine learning project!
